## Inspiration
With meme stocks taking over social media recently, many millenials have jumped into the world of finance without having much-investing experience. Millennials, as they care about making an impact, also want to know how they can invest sustainably. But as first-timers, they donâ€™t know where to start and which company they should invest in.

## What it does
Introducing **Funds for Good**, a platform that allows millennials to easily find and invest in companies based on the issue they care about. We aggregate real-time stock data along with articles about the impacts a company has on the world to determine the metrics score based on their preference. So you can easily invest in companies that align with the causes you most care about, without sacrificing your
performance goals.

- Flask Backend = Central Backend
- Selenium = Web Scraping
